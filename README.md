🔌 Circuit Sage

The Smart Way to Learn Digital Electronics

📖 What is Circuit Sage?

Circuit Sage is an interactive learning platform designed to make Digital Electronics easy, visual, and practical.
Instead of only reading theory from textbooks, Circuit Sage helps students understand how circuits actually work by combining concepts, logic, and simulation-style thinking.

This project is built especially for:

🎓 Engineering students

👨‍🏫 Educators

🧠 Self-learners struggling with digital electronics concepts

❓ The Problem Circuit Sage Solves

“I understand the theory, but I can’t build or visualize the circuit.”

Most students face difficulty connecting:

Boolean logic

Truth tables

Logic gates

Real circuit behavior

Circuit Sage bridges this gap by focusing on clarity, visualization, and structured learning.

✨ Key Features
